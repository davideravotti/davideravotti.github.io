<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>The theory of measure and integration belongs to the foundations of modern analysis, and provides the formal framework for probability theory. This course introduces its central concepts and results (discussing in particular: existence, uniqueness, basic properties, and examples of measures; the abstract Lebesgue integral, convergence theorems, and spaces of integrable functions; product measures; measures with densities; applications to real analysis), and offers brief appetizers for some more advanced topics.
