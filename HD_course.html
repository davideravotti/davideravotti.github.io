<p><b>Lectures:</b> Tuesday 9:45-11:15, Seminarraum 12.
</p>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>The course consists in an introduction to the study of homogeneous flows, which are smooth flows on (quotients of) Lie groups obtained by multiplication by a 1-parameter subgroup. In particular, we will focus on the ergodic theory of Heisenberg nilflows and of geodesic and horocycle flows. We will also explore some connections with topics in number theory.
</p>

<p><b>Assessment:</b>
Oral exam.
